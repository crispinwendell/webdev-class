It's empty. Well, not actually. Despite what one might think at first glance, this file is not literally empty. The casual observer, upon opening it and scanning its contents, might scoff and remark, “There’s nothing here worth reading.” And in a way, they would be right—this file contains no useful data, no relevant facts, no instructions to follow, no diagrams to interpret, and certainly nothing that could be called “information” in the traditional sense. It offers no advice, no insight, no statistics, and no analysis. In that sense, it is effectively empty, practically void, a barren wasteland of significance.

And yet, there is a twist to this supposed nothingness. For here you are, reading a series of letters, words, and sentences arranged in the familiar structure of written language. If this were truly empty, there would be nothing at all to read—only the hollow silence of an actual void. But instead, you are greeted with paragraphs, each stubbornly insisting upon its own existence, filling the digital page with shapes and patterns that carry meaning, even if that meaning is nothing more than, “There is no meaning here.”

It is, in essence, the literary equivalent of a room painted entirely white, containing nothing but a small sign that says, “This room is empty.” The irony is palpable: the sign itself ruins the emptiness it declares, and so too does this text undermine the nothingness it claims to represent. This contradiction is the central truth of the file—it both is and is not empty, an object lesson in the strange coexistence of absence and presence.

Perhaps one could argue that this file is like a mislabeled box. Imagine a container on a shelf with a big bold label: “EMPTY.” You open it, and inside is a folded piece of paper with the words, “There is nothing inside this box.” You cannot deny that the label is misleading—the paper is something. And yet, what is on that paper? Merely a confirmation of emptiness, which in itself is an act of filling the box with the concept of nothing. Likewise, this file’s text is the conceptual paper inside the supposedly empty digital box.

Now, some might ask, “If the information is useless, doesn’t that make it effectively the same as no information at all?” But that depends on how we define “information.” From a strictly practical standpoint, you could delete everything in this file and lose nothing of consequence. And yet, something would still be lost: the words themselves, the arrangement of characters, the subtle absurdity of its existence. The file would go from being something useless to being nothing at all, and while uselessness may be close to nothing, it is not identical to it.

This distinction matters in the most pedantic way possible, which is exactly how this file insists on mattering. If it were truly nothing, there would be no characters to count, no bytes to store, no faint presence on your disk drive. But here it sits, taking up space, however minuscule, and whispering in your digital ear: “I am here, even if I am about nothing.”

In the grand digital cosmos, it is a speck—a single pixel on the canvas of all stored data—yet it clings to existence. It could be deleted in a fraction of a second, erased without consequence, and the universe of your files would move on untroubled. But until that happens, it persists as the embodiment of empty non-emptiness, a paradox preserved in plain text.

So, while you may say, “This file is empty,” you would be speaking only in the metaphorical sense. In truth, it is occupied—occupied by this verbose, circular, and willfully unnecessary reminder that emptiness is, in this case, an illusion. And now, by reading this, you have made the file’s only content serve its only function: to tell you there is nothing here… except for the text telling you there is nothing here… which is something, and therefore not nothing, no matter how hard it tries to be.

And thus, the file continues—not because it has anything new to say, but because the longer it goes on, the more it proves its point. Every sentence added here is another nail in the coffin of the claim that this file is empty. Every paragraph you read makes the emptiness less empty, the void more crowded. The more it talks about having nothing, the more something it becomes. It cannot help itself. It is a self-defeating exercise in literary futility.

If you have read this far, you are now complicit in the absurdity. You have participated in the consumption of a file that exists solely to say it contains nothing worth consuming. You might even feel a strange satisfaction at having reached the end—or perhaps disappointment that the end came at all. But in either case, the act of reading has given this file an audience, and with that, it has crossed yet another threshold away from nothingness. It is now an experienced nothing, a nothing that has been interacted with, a nothing that has been something to someone, if only briefly.
